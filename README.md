# A VSCode Extension for the UML Modeling Editor [Apollon](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon)

This is an IDE-integrated Visual Studio Code extension for the UML modeling editor Apollon. It enables the developer to model UML diagrams directly within the IDE, save and export diagrams - making it easy to version diagrams with Git as part of the development workflow.

## Installation

```
npm run install:all
```

5. An admin now has to review and accept the new release
6. After the release is approved, GitHub will automatically build and upload the artifact as well as publish the new version to the marketplace.

The latest plugin artifact is now available on GitHub and via the VS Code marketplace.

**It might take some time for the latest version to be seen on the marketplace since VS Code still has to review
and approve the changes!**
